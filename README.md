Yoshi is a tool for creating native HAIKU dialog windows from the bash shell or other scripting languages.

This is a _ALPHA_ version and the documentation is not well established yet. The program power can be seen by exploring the files in the Example folder and viewing the [wiki](https://github.com/bbjimmy/Yoshi/wiki).  Most of the options for the various sections are included, some are commented out with a "#" so that yoshi will ignore the line.

if one is familiar with [pashua](http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/) for the mac, one can see the inspiration for yoshi. Yoshi and pashua share some elements, however, yoshi is less complete, but still quite usable:
