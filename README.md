Yoshi is a scripting input add-on for HAIKU bash scripts. 

This is a _BETA_ version and the documentation is not well established yet. The program power can be seen by exploring the files in the Example folder.  Most of the options for the various sections are included, some are commented out with a "#" so that yoshi will ignore the line.

if one is familiar with [pashua](http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/) for the mac, one can see the inspiration for yoshi. Yoshi and pashua share some elements, however, yoshi is less complete, but still quite usable:
